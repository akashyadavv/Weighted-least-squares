The method of least squares is a standard approach in regression analysis to approximate the solution of over determined systems by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals made in the results of every single equation. The most important application is in data fitting. But this project specifically focuses on weighted least squares which is a generalization of ordinary least squares and linear regression in which the errors covariance matrix is allowed to be different from an identity matrix.
In this project we are discussing how, using the power of the weighted least squares approach with linear algebra can help to produce more accurate statistical information that allows for those who are performing analysis of data to make more informed inferences.
